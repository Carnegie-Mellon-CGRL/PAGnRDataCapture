This repository has code for simulating the evolution of the pulmonary arterial tree with vascular growth and remodeling. GnRSource includes the basic G&R code for a single blood vessel. It can be compiled using the command "make" with the default arguments specified in the Makefile and will generate an executable. This executable should be copied to TreeHemodynamicSource to run simulations of the PA tree with growth and remodeling. The default case is run from "run_tree_GnR.m" and includes uniform inflammation down the PA tree, which generates vessel narrowing and increased PA pressures, as in PAH. There are a number of options for running different scenarios, which can be specfied from the flags in the main file or through changing parameter values and the comment/uncommenting in "write_Native_in.m". The GnR executable should also be copied to CoupledModelSourc, which is a set of in-progress scripts written with the goal of capturing experimental data from time course data on PA remodeling.
